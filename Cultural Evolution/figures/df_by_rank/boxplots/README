Each plot displays the distributions of document frequencies of words shared
between patent pairs, binned by what rank each term was in its patent's top
13 words.

Each box-and-whisker plot shows:
  + the median of the distribution as a red bar
  + the upper and lower quartiles as the top and bottom of the box
  + the standard range of data as the whiskers
  + outliers as points beyond the whiskers
    

I'm not exactly sure how pyplot determines what an outlier is, but
assume it has to do with standard deviations or inter-quartile-ranges,
both of which explain why the whiskers extend close to zero below each
box.

I checked what the minimum doc frequencies are for each bin/box, to
explain why each bottom-whisker apparently extends down to 0.
