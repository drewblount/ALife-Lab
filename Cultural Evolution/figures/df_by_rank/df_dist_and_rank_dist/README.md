In this folder are plots where representations of two related 
data-sets are superimposed:

1. The document-frequencies of shared terms, ordered by the tf-idf
   rank of those terms in the patents which share them
	  * for a term T, the doc.-freq. is the number of patents in our
	    corpus that contain T
	  * for a rank n (from 1-13), displayed is a box-and-whisker plot
	    of the doc-freqs of all shared terms of rank n, explained in
		further depth in the original [boxplots folder](https://github.com/drewblount/ALife-Lab/tree/master/Cultural%20Evolution/figures/df_by_rank/boxplots).
	  * these box-and-whisker plots are not shown in their entirety so that median
	  	trends can be observed. The whole plots are at the link above.
2. The number of shared terms per rank, displayed as a histogram as
   in the [sh_term_rank folder](https://github.com/drewblount/ALife-Lab/tree/master/Cultural%20Evolution/figures/sh_term_ranks).
