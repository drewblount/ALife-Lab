each .csv contains 13 rows of data, where the ith row is a list of the document
frequencies of shared words of rank i.

For random patents, p1 and p2 are names for the patents which were randomly
chosen first and second, so we don't expect to see a significant difference between
those data (and we don't see such a difference).

For citation pairs, p1 represents CHILDREN, and p2 parents (this is a little unintuitive, I know,
but I set the standard at some point and wish only to be internally consistent). Again, it seems
that there's a big difference between the distribution of cite and random pairs of patents,
but little difference between parents and children.
